# Tastily - to empower everyone to have the best possible nutritional experience
Using **data science and machine learning** to build data driven recipes to help people consume their individually needed nutrients. Goal is to help reduce current and future nutritional deficiencies by using guided ML based nutrition to get those on medical diets, or anyone interested in improving their health through guided nutrition, to get their blood numbers in the recommended ranges.

## Passion behind the idea
I've always been passtionate about nutrition (studied nutrition in college) and strive to eat what's right, but it's actually incredibly hard! I'd love to help those with deficiences (which is about 95% of the population, including myself) and those on diets for a medical condition, including my wife who is on the renal diet for chronic kidney failure.

And this is how the nutritional startup idea was born!
